#Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is a dummy dataset of World bank. It contains the per capita income of Canada from the year 1970 to 2016. The dataset was already been preprocessed to remove any missing or invalid data points.

#Model
The model is implemented using the Python language and the scikit-learn library. It uses a simple linear regression algorithm to predict the per capita income based on the year. The following libraries have been imported for use in the model:

*numpy* is a library for numerical computing in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
*pandas* is a library for data manipulation and analysis.
*matplotlib* is a plotting library for Python.
*sklearn* is a machine learning library for Python that provides tools for data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
The model has been trained using the 80% of dataset and the performance metrics have been evaluated using evaluation metrics such as R-squared.
